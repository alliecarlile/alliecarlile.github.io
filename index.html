    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in May of 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Biology and a minor in Environmental Studies. Born and raised in Oklahoma, I moved to the Chicago area to work for the U.S. Geological Survey at the Indiana Dunes National Park after working as a remote intern throughout my last two years of college. I began coding and working with data as a USGS intern, almost exclusively in R. As I gained experience with field work, data visualization and analytics became more and more exciting to me. In June of 2022, I decided to pursue a Certificate of Data Science and Visualization from Northwestern University, where my interests grew beyond data analysis, into machine learning, web scraping, and even web design.  </p>
